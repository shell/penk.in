[Missing Drawer](<https://github.com/jezdez/textmate-missingdrawer>) is a better sidebar for Textmate project.

First thing to notice, is when you hiding project drawer it automatically resizes text window, so you can enjoy full screen without more actions.

Also it adds "Open Terminal Here" button. Handy! Because you never need <code>cd</code> to working directory anymore.

Although, there was a bug when you use it with iTerm 2. It always open new window instead of new tab. _fixed_

Also added nice enhancement that save me couple of seconds every day - <code>GitX</code> button.
